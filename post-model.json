  "Summary": "I want to see more bike racks in safe neighborhoods so that the community doesn't need to worry about having our property stolen. I’m also concerned about the safety of getting to the current racks as I was almost jumped.",
  "Author": "Ronald Weasley",
  "Story": "The area that I live in is known to have quite a few delinquent youth living here. I think it would be in the best interest of the community to have a plan for putting more bike racks and bike cages in safer, well lit areas that have high foot traffic. Lighting is especially important because someone tried to jump me when I was coming out of work to collect my bike. This is important because it keeps the delinquent activity minimal as most people won’t act if there are lots of people to witness their actions. Maybe put them in the business allies?",
