    "Story": "The area that I live in is known to have quite a few delinquent youth living here. I think it would be in the best interest of the community to have a plan for putting more bike racks and bike cages in safer, well lit areas that have high foot traffic. Lighting is especially important because someone tried to jump me when I was coming out of work to collect my bike. This is important because it keeps the delinquent activity minimal as most people won’t act if there are lots of people to witness their actions. Maybe put them in the business allies?",

			"Summary": "Over the past few weeks I've noticed a lot of shady activity in that area. Several guys in hoods crowded in the alley ways are known to be there during the late night hours. I'm concerned that they are planning something and are up to no good.",
			"Author": "Hermione Granger",
			"Story": "There’s been a lot of shady activity in the area around Chambers and West 11th over that few days. The alleys always seem to have some kind of group hanging out there and I’m scared that they could do something to the people that are out in the later hours. I feel an increased police presence would be a good action as it would show that we don’t encourage or tolerate that kind of activity. It would also provide a better reaction time in the worst case event that someone ends up getting hurt because of these people.",

			"Author": "Sirius Snape",
			"Story": "Let’s face it, kids and adults aren’t the smartest when it comes to biking safety. I believe that it would benefit the entire community to host several events that would promote safety awareness, road sharing, general rules of the road, and maybe even a certification system that would reward those that complete a certain number of these events. It would make the roads safer, make both bikers and drivers more aware of common pitfalls in the observance of safety on the roads.",

			"Summary": "My neighborhood has been wanting to have a community supported disposal center for food waste aside from just tossing it in the garbage. We feel that having a compost center and pickup system for food refuse would be a great solution! Plus, we could support the center by purchasing the compost for the gardening season.",
			"Author": "Arthur Weasley",
			"Story": "Have you ever wondered if there would be a better way to dispose of and utilize food waste? Well, my neighborhood has. We want to propose a system of collection or delivery intake for food waste on a daily basis to a site outside of the Eugene proper so that we can start a city compost center. Refuse would be sorted and taken to appropriate areas for composting and as the seasons change, people can support the system by purchasing either in bags or loose bulk the compost for their gardens and whatnot. All funds would be kept within the system to sustain it and there would be an incentive based donations system.",

We need some new signs put up in such a way that its much more difficult for them to be removed. Also, can you guys put up some more stop signs? There's a lot of cars that just fly by and I’m concerned that the kids are gonna end up getting hurt.",

			"Author": "Jenny Williams",
			"Story": "I like the idea of adding more artistic installments in the downtown area. Especially in the form of murals and sculptures of the history of the Eugene area. The styling is up for popular vote but I would love to see some high end graffiti added in! We could do a fundraising event to support the local artists and even pair aspiring youth with the project leaders!",

			"Author": "Susie Shores",
			"Story": "The spread of STD’s in the Lane County area is outrageous and I feel that it is largely in part due to the lack of education regarding safe sex. I feel there is a major need to educate the young people and even adults in the practice of abstinence, protected sex, and sanitary practices to avoid the spread of disease, illness, and misfortune. A simple solution would be to put more of an emphasis on this issue in Sex ED as well as in clinics.",
